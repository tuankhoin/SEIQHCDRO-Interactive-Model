## Introduction

In the past outbreaks, Vietnam has successfully controlled the COVID-19 pandemic by simultaneously applying numerous strategies, including aggressive contact tracing, mandatory quarantine, routine testing, etc. Taken inspiration from our own hometown, to quantify the effectiveness of social governance measures, we have developed a multi-compartment model that integrates all of these practices to estimate impacts of possible mitigation scenarios on the COVID-19 outbreak for any given location, using the SEIQHCDRO model, a multi-variable data modelling/machine learning model. 

In order to turn our research into an open-source web-app that everyone can access and use with ease, as well as creating a tool for policy makers/public health specialists to facilitate their policy advocate/policy making process, this modelling tool is created as a result. **Through this website, anyone can predict their own COVID outcome within any region, only through adjusting common social inputs.**

## Deployment Instructions

Requirements:
* Python 3 (work best with Python 3.6)
  
Steps:
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/tuankhoin/SEIQHCDRO-Interactive-Model`
2. Install all dependencies: `pip install requirements.txt`
3. Run `app.py`

## Technical Specifications

This tool is built on Python 3.6, using the following tools:
* **Dash/Flask**: Framework
* **Plotly**: Plotting and framework
* **Heroku**: CI & Deployment platform

For all installed Python libraries, refer to `requirements.txt`.

## Formation of the model 

### Model Flowchart

As an multi-compartment epidemiological model, there must exist specific relations between each and every single compartment. Such relations are expressed though the model flowchart below

![Flowchart](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1nb9DFzmOBdlbp8eSaMUsKA45owrYauf_)                  

## Formula

<details>
<summary>Expand!</summary>

From this, we develop a system of differential equations to simulate the relationship between these compartments. The system reads:

![Formula](https://quicklatex.com/cache3/2e/ql_5948b14b283613968f0b24fb80533a2e_l3.png)

with two main types of hyper-parameters
* Proportion-related hyper-parameters `p`;
* Time interval related hyperparameters `T`.

To obtain the result, this system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) will be solved using the `solve_ivp` command within the `SciPy` package in Python. To prevent any stiffness of the system, the `Radau` method, i.e the implicit Runge-Kutta method of the Radau IIA family of order 5.

## Formulation of the basic reproduction number `R_0`

One of the most important aspects of this model is the ability to capture different levels of social distancing/lockdown to the spread of the disease. As such, we have integrated these impacts onto the function representing the effective reproduction number `R_t` (i.e the basic reproduction number `R_0` with respect to time).

![r0_formula](https://quicklatex.com/cache3/f7/ql_580fe4eb71ceadb277d725dd86ca49f7_l3.png)

Assume that there exists two consecutive time intervals separated by a policy scheme change at time `T`. Before time `T`, the population inherits a scheme with change of the basic reproduction number `delta R_0`, contact rate reduction `p_cont` and contact rate reduction due to journalism `p_jrnl`. After time `T`, the population now inherits a new scheme with a new set of parameters, `delta R'_0`, `p'_cont` and `p'_jrnl`, respectively.

There are two cases that would happen:

* When `p'_cont >= p_cont` (i.e. the social distancing/lockdown measure tightens), the new function is:
  
    ![case1](https://quicklatex.com/cache3/9e/ql_11ac62405647900135857d3b2d429b9e_l3.png)

* When `p'_cont < p_cont` (i.e. the social distancing/lockdown measure loosens), the function now becomes:

    ![case2](https://quicklatex.com/cache3/84/ql_1a46c5cd376b5ef2c5fa51f23f675484_l3.png)

## Tool features

<summary>Expand!</summary>

### Modelling features

In order to create the most interactive and convenient tool possible for COVID-19 modelling, we have decided to opt for 
a number of features that makes it more comfortable for users to interact with this web application, including
* The ability to capture 10 different policy schemes in place, corresponding to 10 consecutive time intervals. This would
be helpful for policy advocates to simulate effects of different policy making processes.
* 3 pairs of plots representing different aspect of the outbreak with built-in gadgets of `Plotly` for generated plots, including:
    - **Overall trend of infection**: Incidence and cumulative number of hospitalized/infected COVID-19 cases,
    - **Critical and fatal cases**: Number of active critical cases daily and cumulative number of deceased cases,
    - **Spread and containment**: Effective reproduction number (Basic reproduction number by day) and total number of quarantined individuals.  
* Ability to export all statistical data of a newly calibrated model in a personalized file name, including
    - Information summary of the model (in either a .txt file or a .json file for further uploading and re-calibration); 
    - Total hospitalized/infected/critical/fatal cases in a single CSV file.
* Comparision with the current capacity for the number of quarantined/hospitalized cases

### Cross-checking and testing features

To facilitate the validation and cross-checking of models between users, we provide the following additional features:
* Samples .json files of the previous outbreaks in Vietnam, including the outbreaks in 
    - Danang (07-08/2020);
    - Hai Duong (01-03/2021); and 
    - Bac Giang (05-07/2021).
* Import (Upload) a .json file that includes all information of the previously calibrated model to continue further moedification 
    without having to restart the whole process from the beginning;
* Upload a csv file of the actual situation and illustrate it alongside with the prediction model. The uploaded csv file can include 
    up to 5 following fields:   
    - Number of new (incidence) cases per day (`daily_infected`);
    - Total (cumulative) number of cases (`cumulative_infected`);
    - Number of active critical cases (`active_critical`);
    - Total (cumulative) number of deaths (`cumulative_deaths`);
    - Number of active quarantined individuals (`active_quarantined`).
